## how to add images to your README.md

Today I learned how to put images to your markdown text file. 나의 md 파일에 이미지를 넣어보자.

`![alt text](screenshots/filename.png "Description goes here")`

`![alt tag](http://domain.com/path/to/img.png "Description goes here")`

You can use the image from your own repo or just simply use image url link.

voalá!!! super duper easy.
