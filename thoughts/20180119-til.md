> 직접 ui 일을 하면서 겪은것도 있고 공감이 되는 글이었다. "why I am doing what I am doing" 에 대해 다시한번 리마인드 할 수 있었다. 개발공부를 하면서 디자인의 끈을 항상 잃지 말기. 많은 훌륭한 디자인 분야 사람들이 나에게 많은 영향과 희망을 주었듯 나도 꼭 나눠주는 사람이 되자.

> Kevin Kelly: We have a moral obligation to increase the amount of technology in the world, the amount of possibilities. And that’s sort of what technology is doing over time. That’s its role, is to increase the variety, the diversity, the options, and the possibilities that we have so that anybody who is born would be able to surprise God. And so I think that’s what it is — **it’s a way of generating surprises.** And that’s the spiritual dimension of technology. It makes that much more likely.
