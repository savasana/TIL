## how to make "skip to content"

### what is a skip links?
These are invisible links that let you skip a group of navigation items and go straight to the main content area.(for screenreader and tab keyboard)


### Don't use `display:none`
sreenreader wil ignore the element if you set the display to none.


### how to use?

```css

.skip-link:not(:focus) {
  /* Workaround for falsely pronounced, smushed text */
  white-space: nowrap;
  /* Set it to the smallest posscible size (some screen readers ignore elements with zero height and width) */
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  /* Hide overflowing content after resizing */
  overflow: hidden;
  /* Reset any property that may change the elements size */
  border: 0;
  padding: 0;
  /* Clipping defines what part of an element should be displayed. */
  /* Deprecated clip property for older browsers */
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  /* clip-path for newer browsers. inset(50%) defines an inset rectangle that makes the content disappear. */
  clip-path: inset(50%); 
  /* It seems like at the moment nobody is quite sure why margin: -1px is there. On top of that it seems to cause issues (see: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1985). */
  margin: -1px;
}

```

There's also other way to implement it.

## What is the margin collapsing?

When two elements are touching each other in a vertical way, margin collapsing occurs.

let's assume there are two box elements vertically aligned.
Box A - margin bottom : 15px 
Box B - margin top : 20px

It’s easy to think that the outcome would be 35px but it’s not correct. The result margin is 20px.
**The largest margin stays and smallest margin collapsed to 0.**
**Max(top margin, bottom margin)**

Margin collapsing only occurs where two(or more) top and bottom margins are touching, and it doesn’t happen at all with left and right margins.


## How about negative margins?

**Max(positive margins) - Max(negative margins)**
