### what is Javascript?

Javascript is...

- Multi-paradigm 
  - prototype-based object-oriented : stype of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing object via delegation that serve as prototypes. Prototype object oriented programming uses generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended.

  - imperative programming : a paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. it focuses on describing how a program operates.

  - functional programming : a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.First-class and higher-order functions. Pure functions. Recursion.

  - event-driven programming : Flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensors, or messages from other programs.Dominant paradigm used in GUI and others that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.

- High-level : programming language with strong *abstraction* from the details of the computer. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.

- Dynamic programming : high-level programming languages, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation.

- Weakly typed : some programming languages make it easxy to use a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. This is sometimes described as 'weak typing'. 'strong typing' generally refers to use of programming language types in order to both capture invariants of the code, and ensure its correctness.
