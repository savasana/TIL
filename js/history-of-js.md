Netscape vs NCSA Mosaic [more about Netscape at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser))

NCSA Mosaic was the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web. In following year, Masaic Communications was founded in California to create [Mosaic Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator). (It shared no code with NCSA Mosaic) The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla (which stood for 'Mosaic killer'). The first version of the Web browser Mosaic Netscape 0.9 was released in late 1994. Whithin four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browsers market and became the main browser for the internat in the 1990s.
The browser was renamed **Netscape Navigator** to avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA.

In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. Netscape Communications decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days in May 1995.

In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server.

Microsoft released a JScript, a reverse-engineered implementation of Netscape's Javascript.  JScript and Javascript had noticeable differences and that made it difficult for designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers. (this was the early years of the **browser wars* )

In November 1996, Netscape submitted Javascript to [Ecma International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape.This led to the official release of the language specification ECMAScript published in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard in June 1997 with JavaScript being the most known of the implementations.

 
ECMAScript 3 : 1999 Third Edition , baseline for modern day Javascript
ECMAScript 4 : never completed
ECMASCript 5 (ECMAScript 3.1) : one of the most supported versions of JavaScript.
ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6): 2015, Sixth edition of ECMA-262 standard. major changes and improvements to the ECMAScript specification.
