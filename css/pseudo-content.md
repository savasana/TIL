`counter` can be useful when you have ranked items.
The value of a CSS counter, generally a number. It can be displayed using the `counter()`  function.


The counter() function has two forms: `counter(name)` or `counter(name, style)`. The generated text is the value of the innermost counter of the given name in scope at the given pseudo-element. It is formatted in the specified style (`decimal` by default).
